# tea
below are two recipes for chai, each serving one. the first is a strong, water-based recipe; the second is a sweeter, milkier, pune-style 'amruttulya' variant.

## wake-up tea

“Is the world to go to hell, or am I to go without my tea? I say that the world may go to hell for me so long as I always get my tea” – Dostoevsky, Notes from the Underground

### ingredients
* 3/4 cup water
* 1/4th cup milk
* 1 thumbnail-length of ginger
* pinch of sugar (add a full teaspoon if you like. the pinch is just to 'cut' the spice of the ginger)
* 7-8 sprigs of mint
* 2.5 teaspoons of tea (granulated black, preferably wagh bakri)

### process
* Wash, then grate the ginger into the water. Bring the water to boil.
* Add mint leaves, wait a little.
* Add the tea, and the milk shortly after. Bring to a boil, let it 'cook' for a little while if wanted.
* Strain and drink.

## mehfil tea

“Meanwhile, let us have a sip of tea. The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos, the fountains are bubbling with delight, the soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle. Let us dream of evanescence and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things.” – Kakuzo Okakura, The Book of Tea

### ingredients
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup milk (preferably full fat, creamier the better)
* 1 thumbnail-length of ginger
* 2-3 cardamom sprigs
* 2 teaspoons of sugar
* 2.5 teaspoons of tea (granulated black, preferably wagh bakri)

### process
* Wash the ginger, then crush it with the cardamom in a mortar.
* Combine the milk and water and put on the stove to boil at medium-heat. Add the sugar, continuously stirring such that the mixture doesn't boil over.
* Once at a boil, add the tea powder, stirring all the while. Also add the cardamom and ginger.
* Strain and drink.
* Continue stirring until a reddish color appears.
