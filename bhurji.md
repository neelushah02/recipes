# egg bhurji
aka indian scrambled eggs. serves two.

### dry ingredients
* 1 tsp jeera (cumin)
* 1 tsp salt 
* 1/2 tsp haldi (turmeric)
* 1 tsp red chili powder
* 1 tsp dhaniya (coriander) powder (optional)
* 1 tsp egg curry masala (optional)

### wet ingredients
* 2 onions, coarsely chopped.
* 2 tomatoes, coarsely chopped.
* 1 green chili, finely chopped.
* 2-3 tsp cooking oil. use groundnut oil if available.
* 4 eggs

### process
* Let oil heat a little on medium flame.
* Put jeera, chilies, onion in together, sauté until onions go brown.
* Add the tomatoes and salt. The salt will help the tomatoes release their juices. Add all other dry ingredients and sauté.
* When the tomatoes stop releasing water and the mixture is drying up, crack eggs directly on top of mixture.
* Keep folding the eggs into the mixture; don't let anything stick to the sides.
* At first the mixture will be one giant blob, but when the eggs start separating out that's a sign you're nearing the end. 
* Garnish with coriander and serve hot.

### notes
* garam masala can be used as well if available.
* break the tomatoes while sautéeing if they're too large.
